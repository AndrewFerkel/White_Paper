In this white paper, I will discuss the nutritional needs of boer goats. I have personal research that goes over the protein content in a certain blend of goat feed that I give to my goats. My audience will be goat farmers that are looking to become more knowledgable on improving their goat's feed intake and efficiency. (how well they convert the feed intake to meat.) I will go over what all the different parts of a healthy diet a goat needs. This includes water, hay, and grain. I will look at the effect that castration has on weight and muscle gain. I will also look into the effect of genetics on weight gain in Boer goats. 

1. What: The nutrition required to efficiently raise Boer goats.
2. Why: Many farmers do not know the specific needs for a goat, and that is partly why they all look tiny and sickly
3. Whether: define terms and how to implement the techniques
4. How: Scientific data and academic research
