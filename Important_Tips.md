Tips to help you write
* Work on it every day. It is much more effective than writing for one whole weekend. 
* Don't stop at the end of a section, but write yourself into the next section. If you write one section and then stop and leave, then you will forget what you were writing about. 
* Always a good idea to ask for a model
* Use of tools. Should track sources so you dont have to go searching for it again. Tool called Zotero. Stalker for Google Chrome. makes citations, manages research notes, stores link, and all other information about the source. You need tools that will extend your brain. 
* Use of placeholders to say you want to place something here then keep going. Do this so you can keep your momentum and not get distracted.
