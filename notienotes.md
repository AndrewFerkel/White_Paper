Images should be:  

- Precise
- Clear
- Fluid
- Familiar

Precise so that the image is not more complicated than the text itself. Don't use a complex image that is not explained well. 

Images cannot stand alone. Cannot assume that just becasue its a picture, your audience can understand what it is. caption the image to give proper credit, and to tell your readers what they are looking at. 

Transition between text and illustration. bridge the gap. Use terminology consistently. Make sure you dont abbreviate randomly. position image appropriatly so their eye hits it at the appropriate place so they read the text right before the image. sufficient white space to let reader smoothly process. 

Consider what your audience already knows. When talking about scale, be sure to include something everyone has experience with like a coin. 

### for the paper

* CTA
* Sources. mostly academic, but all of them dont need to be. dont have to direct quote everything, can paraphrase then still credit source. 
* IDEA use forums of people asking what the feed goats.
