## Abstract

One of the most important parts of raising goats is tending to their nutrition needs. Goats have a four compartmented stomach that contains acid and specific enzymes that break down organic matter and make it digestable. The first stomach compartment is the rumen, which is where food is ground and sometimes brought back up to be chewed again. This is what happens when an animal is chewing its cud. To keep the goat's digetive system in working order, it is important to provide plenty of fiber. This comes in the form of hay, brush, thorns, or other woody plants. A goat needs much more fibber than other animals because their stomach is so different. The other main concern in Boer goat nutrition is protein content. Goats need to be supplemented with grain that has a high enough protein contenet to keep up with their metabolism. This helps them to maintain their weight, or put on pounds depending on what you are doing with your herd. In this article, I will discuss the important of supplementing hay year round with high protein feed. These will be based on scientific research.
