### What are my writing habits?

Usually, I would start three days before, at 10:00 pm. Then a little bit the next morning, in between classes. I will then finish the other homework I have that is due for the next day. The night before the paper is due, I will sit down after work (after 8:00p.m.) and start to finish writing. I will finally finish editing the paper about 3:00 a.m.

### How might they improve?

I will try to start writing tomorrow, so this time I am starting two weeks ahead instead of two days ahead. I am going to try to work on it a little bit when I have time (which is not very much at all). I don't have to work this weekend, so alot of my writing is probably going to be done then. I will still be editing until at least 1:00 a.m. the day it is due. This will suck, because I have another final to study for. My writing will improve when I run away to become a hermit, then I won't have any social obligations, or classes. I will just have time to do homework.

### One strength

I usually make an outline and then just sit and write most of the way through. When I do write, I write in big chuncks at a time then go back and edit later.
